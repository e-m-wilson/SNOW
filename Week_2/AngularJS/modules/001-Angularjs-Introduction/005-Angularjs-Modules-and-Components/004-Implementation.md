# AngularJS Modules and Components : Implementation

## Let's help Luisa create a multi-component app!
- First we need to scaffold an AngularJS project. Refer to previous topics if you need assistance.
- Next, we need to create all three of our components. Each one will need a `module.js`, a `template.html`, and a `component.js` file. 
- Make sure you include any dependencies for nested components within the parent component `module.js` file. This includes our top level module which should have our container component as a dependency!
- Finally, fill in the template files with content. This should include Luisa's prior work experience and skills. Feel free to take some artistic liberty and embellish any details!
- Optionally (but highly recommended) style the application with some css! 
- Check out the demo folder in the topic files to get access to a demo for this challenge and compare with your own work. 

## Exercises

- If we were to take the header component we created ex: `<my-header>`, and place it multiple times within our app, what would happen?

It would render multiple times! This is what's awesome about component based frameworks. We can re-use these modular sections of code as we see fit!
