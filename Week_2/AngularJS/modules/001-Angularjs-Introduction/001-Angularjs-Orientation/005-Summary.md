# AngularJS Orientation : Summary

- AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for creating Single Page Apps (SPAs) within a Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture.
- SPAs don't have to make round trips to the server to render new content for the user, they dynamically change the page for the user via JavaScript.
- MVC architecture is a design principle which defines a clear separation of concerns. 
  - The Model is what holds the data for our application, i.e. records in a database. 
  - The View is our user interface - what the user actually sees. 
  - The Controller defines the logic that manipulates and moves data between the Model and the View.
- AngularJS is NOT Angular. They are completely different frameworks.
