# Filters : Summary

- Filters are applied to expressions within a template and they alter the format of the data returned by the expression.
- There are ready to use pre-built filters in the AngularJS framework.
- We can make our own custom filters.
- In this lesson we discussed the following pre-build filters:
  - Currency - Used to format numbers into a desired currency format. The default is USD but this can be changed.
  - Number - This filter will format numbers into a North American layout with 3 decimal points. The decimal point precision may be customized.
  - Date - This filter will format JavaScript date objects and is very customizable.
  - 'Filter' filter - This filter will create a new array from an existing array based on a matching string, object, or function.
