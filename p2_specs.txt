Project 2 - Implement Fresh Applications and Modules from Scratch in ServiceNow
The ServiceNow IT project includes creating an entirely new Application and Modules using the Application Engine Studio from scratch. It aims to establish a standard procedure for any customer in Single Tenant instances along with Notifications. This project also involves document preparation, such as a Functional Requirement Specification. It is a Blueprint that can be used in the future for any fresh ServiceNow instances by applying Update Sets. This project's completion requires in-depth knowledge of the System Dictionary, Notifications & Events, ACL, Roles, Server-Side (Business Rules, UI Actions, Script Include, Data Policy, etc.), and Client-Side scripting (Client Script and UI Policy), as well as Service Portal.
Requirements:
Platform Implementation:
•	ACLs (Access Control Lists): Implement precise ACL configurations to ensure controlled data access, restricting unauthorized access based on user roles.
•	Notifications: Strategically set up notifications throughout the application to enhance communication and keep stakeholders informed about crucial events and updates.
•	Workflow/Flow: Develop a complex workflow/flow with dynamic approvals to streamline request handling and decision-making processes efficiently.
•	Service Portal Integration: Seamlessly integrate the application with Service Portal, providing users with an intuitive interface for accessing services and information.
•	Catalog Item Creation: Design and implement a catalog item to facilitate the request process for various services, enhancing user experience and improving service request efficiency.
•	Custom Report Creation: Develop custom reports tailored to different user roles, providing insights and analytics based on their specific requirements.
User Roles:
Define and implement 2-3 user roles, specifying their permissions and responsibilities within the application environment.
Data Management:
•	Custom Tables Creation: Create 2 custom tables to store additional data specific to the application, ensuring effective data management and integrity. Additionally, develop various application modules to access records from these tables. (With app engine studio)
•	Knowledge Articles Creation: Develop 2 informative knowledge articles to empower end-users with additional information and guidance, enhancing their understanding of the application functionalities. Place these knowledge articles in a new knowledge base.
ServiceNow Platform Utilization:
Utilize various ServiceNow features, including System Dictionary, Notifications & Events, ACL, Roles, Server-Side (Business Rules, UI Actions, Script Include, Data Policy, etc.), and Client-Side scripting (Client Script and UI Policy). Ensure strict adherence to ServiceNow best practices throughout the implementation process.
Testing Scope:
User Role and Access Control Testing:
•	Validate configured user roles and access restrictions.
•	Verify unauthorized users cannot access restricted data or functions.
Workflow Testing:
•	Test all approval workflows with valid and invalid scenarios.
•	Check workflow rule triggers and email notifications.
Catalog Item Testing:
•	Check catalog item request lifecycle end-to-end.
•	Test for errors, data validation failures, cancellations, etc.
Reporting and Analytics Testing:
•	Verify configured reports fetch expected data.
•	Validate drilling down to report details functions as expected.
 Showcase:
Each team will have 40 minutes to showcase their instance, highlighting the implemented features. This will be followed by a 10-minute Q&A session for addressing queries or concerns.
